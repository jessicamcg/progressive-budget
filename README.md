# Progressive Budget App

## Description
The user is able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that their account balance is accurate when they are traveling.

WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
